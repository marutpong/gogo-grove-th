# 7.1 Writing and Testing Your First Program

The following is a simple program that tells the GoGo Board to beep 10 times every 10th of a second.

to dobeep
    repeat 10 [ beep wait 1] 
end
```

To write Logo programs, select the Tab labeled “Logo” in the GoGo Widget. Enter your logo code in the empty area as shown below.

The same program written in Tinker looks like this:

Click “**Download**” in the GoGo Widget or “**Write to GoGo Board**” in Tinker to send this program to the GoGo Board. Before sending, the program will be checked for errors. If there are any errors, a message will appear allowing fixes to be made. If the program is successfully saved, the GoGo Board will beep once.

When using Tinker, remember to keep the GoGo Widget running in the background. Tinker requires the GoGo Widget in order to communicate with the GoGo Board.

The last step is to run this program. This can be done by clicking on the “Run/Stop” button on the screen or by pressing the physical “Run!” button on the GoGo Board itself. In this example, when the program runs, the GoGo Board will beep ten times. A red “run” LED on the lower-right of the GoGo Board will light up while a program is running and will go off when the program is completed. The whole process is illustrated below.

Once a program has been saved to the GoGo Board, it remains there even when the board is disconnected from the computer or when it looses power. That means the GoGo Board can run the program independently as long as it has power.
